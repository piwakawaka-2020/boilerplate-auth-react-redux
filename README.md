# boilerplate-auth-react-redux

A boilerplate for a react web app with a redux global store and authorisation. This project has two objectives, the first of which is to further my understanding of authorisation while scratch building a full stack web app boilerplate based on the stack taught at Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA), the second objective is to provide a boilerplate for me and my fellow graduates to use in our personal projects going forward.

## .env
